Alex: Hey everyone, thanks for making time today. Before we dive in, let’s do a quick round of intros—just for context, especially since this is the first time some of us are working together on a project.

Morgan: Sure! I’ll start. I’m Morgan, product manager here. I’ll be helping define the scope, user needs, and eventually the go-to-market strategy. Looking forward to this one—it’s a neat little utility with a lot of potential.

Jordan: I’m Jordan, backend dev. I’ll be handling the API architecture, image processing logic, and deployment. I’ve worked on similar tools before, so I’m excited to get into the weeds with this.

Taylor: Hey, I’m Taylor. I’ll be working on the frontend side—mostly the test interface and anything we need for demos or documentation. I’ve done a few image-related projects, so I’m keen to see how this one shapes up.

Riley: I’m Riley, UX designer. I’ll be focusing on the user interface and experience, even if it’s just a simple testing tool. I’ll also help with visuals for documentation and onboarding.

Alex: Awesome. I’m Alex, project lead for this one. I’ll be coordinating across the team, keeping us on track, and making sure we hit our milestones. Alright, let’s get into it.

Alex: So the idea is to build a lightweight API that lets users upload an image, specify dimensions, and get a resized version back. It should be fast, reliable, and easy to integrate into other apps.

Morgan: Are we targeting developers specifically, or is there a broader audience?

Alex: Primarily developers. Think CMS platforms, e-commerce sites, maybe even social media tools. But we want to keep it flexible enough that it could be used in other contexts too.

Jordan: Got it. For the backend, I’d recommend FastAPI. It’s fast, async-friendly, and has great support for OpenAPI docs. For image manipulation, Pillow is fine for basic resizing, but OpenCV gives us more flexibility if we want to add cropping or filters later.

Taylor: FastAPI sounds good. Are we thinking synchronous or asynchronous endpoints?

Jordan: Async, definitely. Resizing can be CPU-heavy, especially with large images. Async will help us handle concurrent requests more efficiently.

Riley: Even though it’s developer-focused, I think we should have a simple web interface. Something clean—upload an image, choose dimensions, maybe a dropdown for aspect ratio options.

Morgan: That could be useful for demos and onboarding. We could even embed it in the documentation.

Alex: Good idea. Riley, can you mock up a wireframe for that?

Riley: Sure. I’ll sketch something out by Monday.

Taylor: I can build a basic React frontend. Just enough to test the API and show results. Maybe add drag-and-drop upload and a preview pane.

Jordan: On the backend, I’ll set up endpoints for upload, resize, and download. We’ll need to validate file types, check dimensions, and sanitize filenames.

Morgan: What formats are we supporting initially?

Jordan: JPEG, PNG, and WebP. Those cover most use cases. We can add SVG and TIFF later if needed.

Alex: Let’s also define resizing modes. I’m thinking:

Fit: maintain aspect ratio, fit within dimensions.
Fill: crop to fill dimensions.
Stretch: ignore aspect ratio.
Taylor: Should we allow resizing by percentage too? Like “scale to 50%”?

Jordan: That’s doable. We can add a scale parameter. But we’ll need to make sure it doesn’t conflict with width/height inputs.

Riley: I’ll mock up visual examples for each mode. It’ll help users understand what they’re choosing.

Morgan: What about error handling? If someone uploads a corrupt image or inputs invalid dimensions?

Jordan: We’ll return structured error responses—status codes, error messages, and maybe suggestions. Like “Invalid dimensions: must be between 50x50 and 4000x4000.”

Taylor: Should we allow users to specify output format? Like upload a PNG and get a JPEG?

Jordan: That’s a good idea. We can add an optional output_format parameter.

Alex: Let’s also think about performance. If we get a lot of traffic, resizing could become a bottleneck.

Jordan: We could use a task queue—Celery or RQ—to offload processing. And maybe cache results for repeat requests.

Morgan: Are we storing the resized images?

Jordan: Temporarily. Maybe for 24 hours. We can use S3 or similar and return a download link.

Taylor: That’ll help with payload size too. No need to send the image directly in the response.

Riley: For the UI, I’ll include a preview and a download button. Maybe even a “copy link” feature.

Morgan: What’s our pricing model? Free, freemium, paid?

Alex: Free tier with rate limits—say 100 requests/day. Paid tiers for higher volume and priority processing.

Jordan: We’ll need authentication. API keys?

Taylor: I can set up a basic key management system. Maybe JWTs for session handling if we expand.

Morgan: Should we log usage stats? Could be useful for analytics and debugging.

Jordan: Definitely. We’ll track request counts, image sizes, formats, and response times.

Alex: What about accessibility and internationalization? Should we consider that for the frontend?

Riley: Good point. I’ll keep the UI simple and accessible—keyboard navigation, alt text, etc. We can add i18n later if needed.

Taylor: Should we support bulk uploads? Like resizing multiple images at once?

Jordan: That’s a stretch goal. Let’s focus on single image for MVP, but keep bulk in mind for v2.

Morgan: What’s our timeline?

Alex: Let’s aim for a working MVP in 3 weeks. Jordan, you start on the backend. Taylor, frontend. Riley, wireframes. Morgan, draft a product brief and pricing model.

Jordan: I’ll set up the repo and CI/CD pipeline today.

Taylor: I’ll start scaffolding the frontend this week.

Riley: I’ll share wireframes by Monday.

Morgan: I’ll work on the messaging and maybe a landing page for early access.

Alex: Awesome. Let’s meet again next Thursday to review progress. Thanks, everyone!
